<h1>Time and Space Complexity</h1>
	<p>Time complexity is test to check that how much the code is efficient.</p>
	<p><b>Space Complexity </b> is the measure of the space taken by the code,It is measured by few ways like measuring it by average space complexity,worst space complexity and by best space complexity or O(1) for constant,O(n) for average case.</p>
